# Project Handoff Checklist


## Requirements for clients

- [ ] Github.com organization or user to transfer the apps
  - [ ] Target Github Organization should have a paid plan (5 users at $25 USD a month)
  - [ ] As an alternative, we can transfer to individual accounts, but process is a bit tricky:
    1. Repo should be transferred to an individual account in the source organization
    2. The individual should transfer the repo to the target individual account - there's no way to complete this without the target account's owner to accept the transfer following a link in an email message.
- [ ] Heroku team to transfer pipelines
- [ ] ???
