# Workshops Handbook

The intention of this workshops handbook is to provide a guide on how to create successful material for a any type of presentation, whether is on a hands-on format or just to provide information.

Keep in ind that this is just a bunch of advices we have learned on the way, and may vary for your particular case.

1. Define the whole objective for the workshop, in other words, what are some the things you want people to keep when leaving.
2. Have an intriguing title, something that catches people's eye.
3. Define an agenda, whether you are sharing it or not, it will help you set the steps for the workshop, and very important, **time**.
4. Provide real life examples, or as close to that, so assistants can easily relate them to their daily work, or even better, to apply what they just learned.
5. Be open to questions and interrumptions, but don't let them consume the whole conversation. In this cases, we recommend you to spare some time at the end to clarify in more detail the concerns.
6. In some cases, it is useful to have a script prepare, it does not have to be very long or descriptive, just for you to remember the next idea, and to provide the right information.
7. Mastery comes from practice. Try to practice the presentation with a friend, a relative, or even your pet. This exercise will help you listen to yourself, and with all together, to verify o correct some areas of opportunities.
8. If you have the chance, record the workshop, this will have two benefits:
  * For you to see it and learn from it
  * You can sell or share the content for later
9. During the workshop, when changing from one topic to another, ask if there is any question that you can address before moving on.
10. Watch the tone of your voice, if you are on a big place, you may or not be heard from every corner. You can ask the audience if that is the case.

We have provided a [template](TEMPLATE.md) where you just need to fill some information to give you some sort of notion on where to go, or at least answer some basic questions you were not aware of.
